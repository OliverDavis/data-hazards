# Data Hazard labels

This page contains the Data Hazard labels themselves.
These labels, descriptions, examples, and safety precautions will evolve as we develop the labels with the communities who use them.
We welcome you to suggest changes, so please check our [contribution guidelines](contribute) if you would like to. 

Each hazard has:
- __Hazard__ image, title, and description which represents and describes the risk.
- __Examples__ to clarify what the hazard covers.
- __Safety Precautions__ - things that we would want to see done **before** the research is deployed.

<!--FYI The numbers after {grid} below refer to the number of columns that should display for xmall (1), small (2), med (3) and large screens (3) -->
