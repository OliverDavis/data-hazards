# 1. Structure and Materials

To begin with we will introduce you to the Data Hazard labels and what a workshop would usually look like. 
This includes the _ethos_ of a workshop, which focusses on the importance of multiple perspectives. 

## Slides
Here are the training slides which are about the Hazards and how the workshops work. 

[TODO: Slides to be inserted here.]

## Timings

We use the following timings for the Data Hazard workshop, it lasts between 90 minutes and 2 hours.
The workshops use a version of a technique from social work known as ['The Reflective Team'](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-15877-8_324-1).
This is designed to help ensure that both the audience and the project owner get an opportunity to speak and listen.

- 5 mins: Housekeeping  
- 20 mins: Data Hazards intro: 
    - what are the data hazard labels?
    - why?
    - case study
- 45 mins: Project discussion in smaller groups using the reflective team exercise:
    - 5 minute project presentation
        - what's the project and who is involved?
        - what are it's aims?
        - what data and methods does it use?
        - what are it's potential applications (if any)?
    - 1 minute audience thinking time  
    - 5 minutes audience asks clarifying questions to the project owner
        - Audience will ask factual questions only,  e.g. a good question “What does the training data look like?” A bad question “Do you think your work is biased?”  
        - Project owner will answer factually only. 
    - 5 minutes filling out form (what hazard labels apply) before discussion
    - 20 minutes discussion (project owner listens without speaking)  
    - 2 minutes fill in hazards again 
    - 5 minutes: project owner speaks while the audience are quiet, saying: 
        - What from the discussion resonated the most with them  
        - What resonated least with them  
- 10 mins: (Back in the main room) Collecting feedback and wrapping up.
