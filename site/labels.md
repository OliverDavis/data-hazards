# Data Hazard labels

__Version 1.0__

This page contains the Data Hazard labels themselves.
We welcome you to suggest changes, so please check our [contribution guidelines](contribute) if you would like to. 

Each hazard has:
- An image, title, and description to describe the Hazard.
- __Examples__ to clarify what the hazard covers.
- __Safety Precautions__ - suggestions of how Hazards could be mitigated.

__06.12.2022: Update new Hazard labels__
[@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara)  
Updated all the images of the Hazards with our new labels designed by the amazing [Yasmin Dwiputri](http://yasmindwiputri.com/)! 


__07.03.2022: Move Data Hazards to individual pages__
[@ninadicara](https://github.com/ninadicara)  
Moved all of the Hazards to their own individual pages, and linked them from the original sphinx panels. 
Also capitalised all of the names so that they are consistently named. 
This should make it easier for people to contribute to a single Hazard and record their contribution against it :)
