# Workshop


The Data Hazards were originally designed around a workshop format. 
This was to allow a series of _Project Owners_ to present a research project to _Audience Members_, who would give them feedback on the ethics of their project. 

<!-- ```{admonition} Upcoming workshops
We are currently planning facilitator training for running Data Hazards workshops to take place in June 2022.
If you are interested in taking part please [email us](grp-ethicaldatascience@groups.bristol.ac.uk)! 

We also plan to run another workshop in June 2022, so keep an eye on our [Events page](events) if you would like to take part.
``` -->

The idea of this was to allow people who were outsiders to the project to give the project owners a new perspective on what the concerns might be. 
This would be guided by a discussion of the Data Hazards, facilitated by a dediated facilitator to make sure that the conversation goes smoothly, and adheres to the [Code of Conduct](../code-of-conduct).

The image below is a prompt which gives an idea of the kinds of prompts the facilitators might make, and that the Data Hazards are designed to encourage.

## Timings

We use the following timings for the Data Hazard workshop, it lasts between 90 minutes and 2 hours.
The workshops use a version of a technique from social work known as ['The Reflective Team'](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-319-15877-8_324-1).
This is designed to help ensure that both the audience and the project owner get an opportunity to speak and listen.

- 5 mins: Housekeeping  
- 20 mins: Data Hazards intro: 
    - what are the data hazard labels?
    - why?
    - case study
- 45 mins: Project discussion in smaller groups using the reflective team exercise:
    - 5 minute project presentation
        - what's the project and who is involved?
        - what are it's aims?
        - what data and methods does it use?
        - what are it's potential applications (if any)?
    - 1 minute audience thinking time  
    - 5 minutes audience asks clarifying questions to the project owner
        - Audience will ask factual questions only,  e.g. a good question “What does the training data look like?” A bad question “Do you think your work is biased?”  
        - Project owner will answer factually only. 
    - 5 minutes filling out form (what hazard labels apply) before discussion
    - 20 minutes discussion (project owner listens without speaking)  
    - 2 minutes fill in hazards again 
    - 5 minutes: project owner speaks while the audience are quiet, saying: 
        - What from the discussion resonated the most with them  
        - What resonated least with them  
- 10 mins: (Back in the main room) Collecting feedback and wrapping up.
